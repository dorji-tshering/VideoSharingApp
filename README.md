# How you should expect it to work basically:
1. You need to signin unless you already have an account.
2. You will be redirected to the main page. 
3. The contents of the Feed and Videos take some time to load if there is       content so you need to switch between screens to refresh and load it. 
4. The recorded video will be automatically displayed on your Videos section.
5. Each video can be edited, shared, or deleted. 
6. Each video is represented by its thumbnail and can click on it to play.
6. The saved video will also get automatically displayed on your Videos section.
7. The shared videos will get displayed on the Feed section. 
8. Like I said, if you don't see the videos there, try switching between sections.


# Additional Notes: 
1. I have tested the app only on android and is quite android oriented.
2. The recorded video is stored on the app cache and there is no feature to save it 
        to the device.
